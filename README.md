# adventofcode2022

This is the code I'm doing to the [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/) of
year 2022. It's in C++, I think it isn't the best choize, but it is the language
I more acostumated to use.

## Day 1

There is two parts. For the first time I'm trying to do it as simple as I can.
This is the normal `main.cc` version.

For the second part I tried a new aproach witouth loops. To do this I had to
implement some new iterators that can be found in the `utilities` folder.

I did a third version that it uses more range library and, I think, it is a bit
more readble.

## Day 2

Elfs like to play Rock, Paper and Scissors. In this case I do a simpler case
and I didn't try to do any esoteric.

## Day 3


## Day 4

This day is time to work with range of numbers and check overlaping conditions.

## Day 5
## Day 6

Too easy do it like me. I have to think in a best solution.

## Day 7

I'm not happy with the parser, but it was easy to do and it works.
